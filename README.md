- 👋 Hi, I’m Oyin @oyindasola1
- 👀 I’m interested in software development with my focus mainly on front-end dev and software testing
- 🌱 I’m currently learning javascript as I've extensively learned both HTML and CSS.
- 💞️ I’m looking to find easy learning methods on JS to help me better understand and move on to creating with it. 
- I am also looking to create small projects that can help me learn.
